Hey there. :)

My name is Heitor Tashiro Sergent. I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I have a big passion for games, burgers and programming. 

I find it weird and awkward writing an About page. I graduated in game development and had my own company together with one of my best friends, and best designer I know called [Rafael Fernandes](http://rafaelfe.com/). We didn't manage to break the one-year barrier, and it still was an amazing experience.

I worked for 18 months as a Developer Evangelist at [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/). It was also an amazing experience. I traveled over 200 days to 30 cities, and met hundreds of people. I also learned the meaning of burning out.

I'm currently working as a developer at a startup called [Azuki](http://www.azk.io/). It's something I've wanted since the company started, and I couldn't be more excited to see where it's gonna go.

If you'd like to reach out to me, you can do so via Twitter [here]({{ site.twitter }}). :)
